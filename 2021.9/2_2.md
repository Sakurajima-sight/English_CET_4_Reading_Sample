# Aquaculture and Global Fish Consumption: Opportunities and Challenges
水产养殖与全球鱼类消费：机遇与挑战

1. We're eating more fish than ever these days.
   现在我们比以往任何时候都要吃更多的鱼。

2. At around 20 kilograms per person global fish consumption is now more than twice what it was in the 1960s.
   每人大约吃20公斤的鱼，全球鱼的消费量现在比1960年代多了两倍。

3. What's really remarkable, though, is where that fish comes from.
   然而，真正值得注意的是这些鱼从哪里来。

4. For the first time in human history, most of our aquatic food now comes from farming rather than fishing.
   人类历史上首次，我们大多数的水产食物现在来自养殖而不是捕捞。

5. People ate around 73 million tonnes of farmed fish - just more than half of the volume of fish that humans consumed -in 2014.
   2014年，人们吃了大约7300万吨的养殖鱼，这比人类消费的鱼的总量多出一半。

6. That's out of a total fish supply of 167 million tonnes; the remaining 20 million or so tonnes go into things like animal feed and medical products.
   总共有1670万吨的鱼供应；剩下的大约2000万吨用于像动物饲料和医疗产品这样的东西。

7. To keep eating fish at the current rate, we're definitely going to need to keep aquaculture developing.
   要以当前的速度继续吃鱼，我们肯定需要继续发展水产养殖。

8. That's because the volume of fish caught in the wild has leveled off since the 1990s.
   这是因为自1990年代以来，野生捕捞的鱼量已经平稳下来。

9. Back in 1974, only 10% of marine fish stocks had been overfished.
   早在1974年，只有10%的海洋鱼类资源被过度捕捞。

10. Now, more than three-tenths are.
    现在，超过三成被过度捕捞。

11. Only a tenth of our oceans' fish stocks could sustain heavier fishing than current levels.
    只有十分之一的海洋鱼类资源能承受比现在更重的捕捞。

12. But while catchings at sea have suffered, fish-farming has been growing at a fast rate.
    虽然海上的捕捞量受到了影响，但是养鱼业正在快速增长。

13. A lot of that is coming from China, which produces 60% of the world's farmed fish.
    其中很大一部分来自中国，中国生产了世界60%的养殖鱼。

14. In fact, some 35 countries, including China, now produce more farmed than wild-caught fish.
    实际上，包括中国在内的大约35个国家现在生产的养殖鱼比野生捕捞的鱼还多。

15. This shift toward aquaculture isn't just good for ensuring salmon on your plate; it's also crucial to ensuring food security and sustainability.
    这种向水产养殖的转变不仅有利于确保你的盘子里有三文鱼，也对确保食品安全和可持续性至关重要。

16. By 2050, the world will need to feed an estimated 9.7 billion people.
    到2050年，全球需要养活预计97亿人口。

17. They'll have to get their protein somewhere.
    他们必须从某个地方获得蛋白质。

18. However, raising cattle, pigs, and other land-based animals requires vast sums of grain and water.
    然而，饲养牛、猪和其他陆生动物需要大量的粮食和水。

19. For example, pound for pound, beef requires 15 times more feed to raise than carp, a freshwater fish farmed all over Asia.
    例如，按照重量计算，养一磅牛肉需要比养一磅鲤鱼多15倍的饲料，而鲤鱼是在整个亚洲都养殖的淡水鱼。

20. That grain - and the water needed to grow it-could be consumed by people instead.
    那些粮食和用于生长它所需的水可以被人们食用。

21. However, aquaculture is no silver bullet.
    然而，水产养殖并非万能良药。

22. In some southeast Asian countries, shrimp farming does disastrous damage to marine ecosystems.
    在一些东南亚国家，养虾业对海洋生态系统造成了灾难性的破坏。

23. Despite these problems, however, shrimp continues to be among the most popular seafoods worldwide.
    尽管有这些问题，但是虾仍然是全球最受欢迎的海鲜之一。
