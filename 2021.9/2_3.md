1. In 2020, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the World Food Programme (WFP).

3. In 2019, the WFP assisted nearly 100 million people in 88 countries.
   在2019年，WFP在88个国家协助了近一亿人。

4. It is the safety net for those who fall off the edge of existence.
   它是那些生活在边缘，即将崩溃的人们的安全网。

5. It is a response to solving the problem of food instability.
   它是解决食物不稳定问题的一个响应。

6. Its Nobel Prize reminds us all of the moral hazard in imagining that the poor and vulnerable are somebody else's problem.
   它获得的诺贝尔奖提醒我们所有人，想象中贫穷和弱势群体是别人的问题是一种道德风险。

7. The WFP has been around since 1961 and has been the global coordinator of nationally based efforts to avoid disasters with food aid.
   WFP自1961年以来一直存在，并且一直是全球协调国家基础努力以避免食品援助灾难的组织。

8. Despite decades of effort to eliminate hunger, the latest estimate is that about 11% of people on the planet (about 820 million people) are suffering daily undernourishment.

9. Developed countries sometimes offer food and aid to developing ones, but at a price.

10. One American philosopher stated that addressing the needs of the poor and vulnerable is about more than money-it is mostly about creating conditions under which prosperity and opportunity can thrive.
    一位美国哲学家指出，解决贫穷和弱势群体的需求不仅仅是关于金钱——主要是关于创造繁荣和机会能够茁壮成长的条件。

11. When aid is offered with heavy conditions attached, like loan repayment or food for resources, it often widens the gap between rich and poor and sustains the old world order.
    当援助附带有严格的条件，如贷款偿还或食物换取资源时，这通常会加大富人和穷人之间的差距，并维持旧有的世界秩序。

12. This is why the work of the WFP is so vital.
    这就是为什么WFP的工作如此重要。

13. The scientific community, however, can provide a helping hand to the WFP.

14. By sharing knowledge of agriculture and climate with peers in countries most vulnerable to poverty and hunger, scientists can help reduce these problems.
    通过与最容易受到贫穷和饥饿影响的国家的同行分享农业和气候知识，科学家可以帮助减少这些问题。

15. By making its voice heard, science can lead by example.
    通过发出自己的声音，科学可以起到示范作用。

16. The ability to overcome food shortages that must be built into some of the poorest countries will not come from loans from wealthy countries, which may have food problems of their own, or world economic institutions.
    要在一些最贫穷的国家中建立起克服食物短缺的能力，这不会来自富裕国家的贷款（这些国家自己可能有食物问题），也不会来自世界经济机构。

17. This ability will be built upon self-confident people using open and shared scientific knowledge to pull themselves out of their misery.
    这种能力将建立在有自信的人们利用开放和共享的科学知识来自我摆脱困境之上。
