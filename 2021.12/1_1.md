    作为一个来自不景气的锈带社区的低收入学生，这些教育经历对于照亮我的未来和我的家庭的未来有着巨大的潜力。

    如果仍然不对劲，尝试协商。

    在父母工作多份工作、对大学官僚机构了解较少、英语语言能力有限或没有为子女的教育贡献经济支持的情况下，自我倡导的负担将落在学生身上。

45. I understand the difficulty, and the embarrassment. But it is necessary.
    我理解困难和尴尬。但这是必要的。

      然而，从宏观角度来看，大学也必须理解，他们要求的隐藏费用对于他们极力吸引的低收入或第一代大学生可能是难以承受的。
