# Evil Genius
邪恶天才

1. A few years ago I found myself teaching a university class on evil.
   几年前，我发现自己在教一门关于“邪恶”的大学课程。

2. It was for third-year criminology students to help them contextualize theory and research within controversial current topics.
   这门课是为了帮助三年级的犯罪学学生将理论和研究置于当前有争议的话题中。

3. It was a huge success.
   这门课非常成功。

4. The debates were heated and interesting.
   辩论非常激烈和有趣。

5. I could see people's views change within the course of a single lecture.
   我可以看到人们在一堂课程中就改变了观点。

6. Over the past 13 years, as a student, lecturer and researcher, I've enjoyed discussing the science of evil with anyone willing to listen.
   在过去的13年里，作为学生、讲师和研究者，我喜欢和愿意倾听的人讨论“邪恶”的科学。

7. What I like most is destroying the cliche of good and evil, and replacing them with scientific insight.
   我最喜欢的是打破关于好与恶的陈词滥调，并用科学的洞察力来替代它们。

8. We need a more informed way of discussing behavior that at first we cannot, or should not, begin to understand.
   我们需要一种更有见地的方式来讨论一开始我们不能或不应该去理解的行为。

9. Without understanding, we risk dehumanizing others, writing off human beings simply because we don't comprehend them.
   如果不理解，我们就有可能剥夺他人的人性，仅仅因为我们不能理解他们。

10. We must try to understand what we have labeled evil.
    我们必须尝试去理解我们所标签为“邪恶”的东西。

11. We tend to think evil is something that other people are.
    我们倾向于认为邪恶是其他人的特质。

12. We think of ourselves as "good people", and even when we do morally wrong things, we understand the context of our decisions.
    我们认为自己是“好人”，即使我们做了道德上错误的事情，我们也理解我们决策的背景。

13. With others, however, it is far easier to write them off.
    然而，对于其他人，把他们一笔勾销要容易得多。

14. If their actions deviate substantially from what we consider acceptable, we may label them evil.
    如果他们的行为大大偏离我们认为可接受的范围，我们可能会给他们贴上“邪恶”的标签。

15. We need to be careful with this.
    我们需要对此小心。

16. Calling someone evil is often similar to saying they cannot change, and perhaps aren't even a human at all.
    称某人为邪恶通常类似于说他们不能改变，甚至可能根本不是人。

17. However, when you actually go monster-hunting, and you look deeply at the people behind shocking behavior, you may be surprised.
    然而，当你真正去寻找“怪物”，并深入观察背后令人震惊行为的人时，你可能会感到惊讶。

18. As a child I used to love the Scooby-Doo cartoons.
    当我还是个孩子的时候，我非常喜欢《史酷比》的动画片。

19. Arriving in their "Mystery Machine", the gang would have to find a monster who was terrorizing a neighborhood.
    他们乘坐“神秘机器”到达，然后必须找到一个正在恐吓社区的怪物。

20. They would run around looking for clues and at the end unmask the bad guy.
    他们会到处寻找线索，最后揭露坏人的真面目。

21. It was always a normal person in a costume.
    总是一个穿着服装的普通人。

22. There were no monsters.
    没有怪物。

23. Like the Scooby crew, we may find ourselves hunting for an easy fix, one word for people who do bad things.
    就像史酷比的团队，我们可能会发现自己在寻找一个简单的解决方案，一个词来形容做坏事的人。

24. But if we take a good look, the word 'evil' is insufficient- there are no simple explanations for why humans do bad things: instead there are many, and they are all marvelously different.
    但如果我们仔细观察，‘邪恶’这个词是不够的——没有简单的解释可以说明为什么人们会做坏事：相反，有很多，而且它们都各不相同。

25. Evil is typically referred to when there is deviance from social norms: formal deviance is the violation of laws, like theft, murder, and attacks, while informal deviance involves violations of social norms, like lying.
    通常在有社会规范偏离的时候会提到“邪恶”：正式的偏离是违反法律，比如盗窃、谋杀和攻击，而非正式的偏离涉及违反社会规范，比如说谎。

26. Evil behavior is typically thought to embrace one or both forms.
    邪恶行为通常被认为包括这两种形式中的一种或两者。

27. However, deviance can also describe a behavior that simply differs from the norm.
    然而，偏离也可以描述一种简单地与规范不同的行为。
